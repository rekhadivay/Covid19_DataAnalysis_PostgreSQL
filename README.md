# Covid19_DataAnalysis_PostgreSQL
#### This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 data to derive insights into various aspects of the pandemic. The analysis includes SQL queries to explore and understand different dimensions of the data.

## Objective:
#### The objective of this project is to analyze and interpret COVID-19 data to gain valuable insights into the impact of the pandemic. The data is sourced from the "Covid_Deaths" and "Covid_Vaccinations" tables.

## Data Source and Process:
#### The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases. 
#### 1. Data was loaded into csv files in "Covid_Deaths" and "Covid_Vaccinations" files.
#### 2. Database and tables created.
#### 3. Importing data from CSV to Database.
#### 4. Data Exploration and Analysis
#### These tables serve as valuable sources of information, providing detailed statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. By employing SQL queries, the project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact on various fronts.

## Queries and Insights:
### 1. Datewise Likelihood of Dying due to COVID-19 in Canada:
#### Explore the progression of total cases vs total deaths on a datewise basis in Canada.

### 2. Mortality Rate in Canada:
#### Calculate the total percentage of deaths out of the entire population in Canada.

### 3. Verification of Information:
#### Verify the information regarding total deaths and population in Canada, it is correct or not.

### 4. Country with the Highest Deaths % of Population:
#### Identify the country with the highest percentage of deaths relative to its population.

### 10. Country-wise COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccination for Age > 65:
#### Explore the total number of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination for individuals aged over 65.

### 11. Country-wise Total Vaccinated Persons:
#### Identify and rank countries based on the total number of fully vaccinated individuals.

### 12. Global Numbers:
#### Calculate the global numbers of total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.

## Conclusion:
#### This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic through data analysis. The insights derived from the SQL queries contribute to our knowledge of the impact of the virus on different regions, age groups, and vaccination efforts. The findings are valuable for informed decision-making and further research into combating the pandemic.
